    ** Module extsay-ng **

To use this module, you have to be running the screen utility.
MCabber's FIFO system must be enabled.

Copy the script extsay.sh to some place on your system and set the mcabber
option 'extsay_script_path' to the file path.  You can set it in your mcabber
configuration file.

Set the option 'extsay_split_win' to 1 if you want the helper script to
split the screen window and open the editor below the mcabber screen window.
This may not work for you, according to your screen configuration.
The option 'extsay_win_height' can be used to specify the height of the newly
created window, if you have enabled splitting.

 /EXTSAY [jid]

When you type /extsay, the module will send a command to screen to open a
new window and run the helper script in it.
This helper scripts launches an editor ($EDITOR), and sends the message using
the FIFO mechanism.

Please note that this script will not work if the editor does detach from
the terminal.

Hope you find this module useful, do not hesitate to send patches for
improvements!
