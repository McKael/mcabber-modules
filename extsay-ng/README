    ** Module extsay-ng **

To use this module, you have to be running the screen utility.

Copy the script extsay.sh to some place on your system and set the mcabber
option 'extsay_script_path' to the file path.  You can set it in your mcabber
configuration file.

 /EXTSAY [jid]

When you type /extsay, the module will send a command to screen to open a
new window and run the helper script in it.

WARNING: If you do not provide a JID, the selected user _at the time you
close the editor_ will be used.  Be careful not to select another contact
while you're editing your message!

Hope you find this module useful, do not hesitate to send patches for
improvements!
